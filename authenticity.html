         <span class="capital-l">I</span>n this playbook, we’ve gathered insights, frameworks, experiences, and principles to understand why we need to re-think the way companies craft authentic experiences that are meant to inspire change.
       </p>
       <p>
         We asked seasoned experts to share valuable lessons and strategies about how to focus on human-first content, build cultures with stronger values, settle clashing perspectives about what it means to run a successful company, and implement sustainable growth strategies.
       </p>
       <p>
         We need to reframe our strategies to be more genuine and sustainable. And this starts with being more authentic in all areas that make a company thrive.
       </p>

       <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
       <p>
         <span class="capital-l">W</span>e see a deluge of newly launched start-ups and a new wave of entrepreneurs who swear by Zuckerberg’s once-notorious motto: “<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-10/zuckerberg-hearings-presage-end-of-move-fast-break-things-era" target="_blank">move fast and break things.</a>”
       </p>
       <p>
         This mindset was devised to spark innovation, but today it encompasses how many entrepreneurs see disruption: speed is key. But is this still the case?
       </p>
       <p>
         According to <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/01/the-era-of-move-fast-and-break-things-is-over" target="_blank">HBR</a>, this mentality forces companies to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/theranos-and-silicon-valleys-fake-it-till-you-make-it-culture/" target="_blank">rush to force products into consumers’ hands as fast as possible,</a> without regard for proper functionality, understanding the market’s needs, or sustainable growth strategies.
       </p>
       <p>
         But mantras like ‘fail fast, fail often’ and ‘move fast and break things’ are starting to fail to live up to expectations when companies begin to consider the long-term impact and ethical responsibility they need to build trust.
       </p>
       <p>
         As <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/treat-me-like-a-person-not-a-persona" target="_blank">HubSpot CTO Dharmesh Shah states in the Customer Code</a> “customers don’t mind paying, but they do mind being played.”
       </p>
       <p>
         Looking at content marketing, the tech world has become saturated with SaaS companies producing content. Most of them mindlessly follow the industry “best-practices” and produce uncompelling content that lacks an authentic story in the pursuit of clicks.
       </p>
       <p>
         We are aware that the “Fake It Till You Make It” mindset originates from the philosophy of positive thinking and implies a theory of “you can do anything” by convincing yourself that you can really do it.
       </p>
       <p>
         And we don’t want to make <i>authenticity</i> just another buzzword that aims to jolt the start-up world.
       </p>
       <p>
         But as <a href="https://blog.samaltman.com/" target="_blank">Sam Altman</a> puts it “We tell startups all the time that they have to grow quickly. That’s true, and very good advice, but I think the current fashion of Silicon Valley startups has taken this to an unhealthy extreme — startups have a weekly growth goal before they really have any strong idea about what they want to build.”
       </p>

       <!-- <h3 id="fake-it">The "Fake It Till You Make It” Concept</h3> -->

       <h2 id="why-authenticity-matters">Why authenticity matters</h2>

       <p>
         <span class="capital-l">A</span>uthenticity is a highly-sought value but very few companies know how to forge a genuine culture and craft strategies that put it at the core.
       </p>
       <p>
         <b>After all, there is no cookie-cutter template for instilling authenticity in a company but there are ways to develop it.</b>
       </p>
       <p>
         To start, think about how we are permanently surrounded by technology; the more we are dominated by the tech world, the more we want to fight the noise and enjoy authentic experiences.
       </p>
       <p>
         Companies know this so they will need to build frameworks that connect with people and offer them the authentic experiences they are looking for.
       </p>
       <p>Authenticity matters because:</p>
       <ul>
         <li>
           <p>It fosters credibility</p>
         </li>
         <li>
           <p>It gives companies a unique personality</p>
         </li>
         <li>
           <p>It allows companies to establish trust</p>
         </li>
         <li>
           <p>It establishes high quality</p>
         </li>
         <li>
           <p>It fosters loyalty</p>
         </li>
       </ul>
       <div class="collab">
         <p>
           In this day and age, you have no choice but to be authentic. People can detect bullshit from miles away, especially online. To be authentic, you first need to understand who you are and what you stand for and against.
         </p>
         <p>
           If you don’t, you’re going to struggle to find your voice and have a tendency to copy what others are doing. It takes time to get to know your true self. It takes time to stop wearing a mask.
         </p>
         <p>
           A good tip to get started is to ask your friends and colleagues what they think you actually stand for and against. You’re going to be surprised by the answers (hint: they are usually the same).

         And in 2019, we have identified a few concepts that further corroborate the need for authenticity:

       </ul>

       <h2 id="authenticity-in-a-company">How to instill authenticity in a company</h2>

       <p>
         <span class="capital-l">T</span>he identity of a company is based on <strong>values, principles, story, vision, and a clear mission,</strong> but it’s also closely linked with the personality and voice that define who you are and what sets you apart from the crowd.
       </p>
       <p>
         InVision says that “the brand’s identity is how it looks and feels”, which means that the elements of a brand are visual. More than the visual direction, the story is always key.
       </p>
       <p>So you could start with, “What is the story you’re telling?”
       </p>
       <p>
         A strong story helps companies convey the type of value they are giving to customers. A story combines every single touchpoint of the user’s experience.
       </p>
       <p>
         It’s essential to start with <a href="https://www.intercom.com/blog/start-with-why-getting-your-story-right/" target="_blank">your company’s compelling story</a>. Crafting your story to define and express your core ideas will help you create a memorable brand.
       </p>
       <p>
         An example is <a href="https://www.intercom.com/" target="_blank">Intercom</a>, which has a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2016/11/01/inside-intercom-fast-growth-out-of-ireland/#60e3ba946968" target="_blank">compelling story</a> that showcases how a messaging platform mimics the ambiance of the coffee shop where the founders used to work.
       </p>
       <p>
         Intercom’s brand focuses on values like personalization, playfulness, creativity and ease of use. These values immediately translate into their visual language: playful colours, quirky illustrations, magazine-like blog.
       </p>
       <p>
         Beyond the visuals, Intercom has weaved its strong story by constantly asking “why.”
       </p>
       <p>
         “No matter how good your product is, if you can’t tell a cohesive, compelling story about it, you’re going to have a very hard time getting people’s attention when you actually do take it to market.” Intercom
       </p>
       <p>
         In a competitive market, a company can’t differentiate itself only by offering a product. The idea is to craft a cohesive story across all the areas of the company starting with the visual brand, the product or service, the mission and vision of the founders, the team, the content, and the marketing.
       </p>
       <p>
         Or as Intercom says it “it’s about understanding why a customer would care about that mission, and translating that understanding into a story that will compel someone to start a trial and ultimately make a purchase.”
       </p>
       <p>
         Every company has a different way of instilling trust in their brand. Buffer puts emphasis on transparency to build trust faster, so they have created a <a href="https://buffer.com/about#transparency" target="_blank">transparency dashboard</a>. Drift’s hypothesis establishes authenticity as a way to trust so they <a href="https://medium.com/the-mission/the-real-housewives-of-tech-marketing-16cc34ebea69" target="_blank">built their own reality TV show</a>.
       </p>
       <p>
         Slack’s manifesto is less deliberate, more organic and shows how <i>humanity</i> builds trust faster than all the other methods. It’s a core part of their voice (<a href="https://slackhq.com/one-voice-many-hands" target="_blank">clear, concise, and human</a>).
       </p>
       <p>
         The human experience is reflected throughout the organization as Slack shares <i>emotion</i> with their readers (<a href="https://twitter.com/slacklovetweets" target="_blank">Wall of Love</a>), and conveys it through <i>quality work</i> by investing heavily into its content creation.
       </p>

         The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.

         Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

       <h3 id="storytelling">1. Storytelling — What Is to What Could Be</h3>

         <p>
           Storytelling and content go hand in hand.
         </p>

         <p>
           Many companies understand that the power of storytelling can transform their presence and identity.
         </p>

         <p>
           Iconic brands like Slack and Intercom have grasped from the very beginning the power of their company story to build an authentic connection with their audience.
         </p>

         <p>
           What’s a story, though? How does a story develop authenticity? How does it build trust?
         </p>

         <p>
           By presenting content, marketing, and customer engagement as a story across the board, you not only make it compelling but immediately establish common ground with your audience.
         </p>

         <p>
           <a href="https://buffer.com/resources/science-of-storytelling-why-telling-a-story-is-the-most-powerful-way-to-activate-our-brains" target="_blank">It’s scientifically proven that stories are easier to remember than facts</a> and will have a lasting impact on whatever we do.
         </p>

         <p>
           When you craft a story, use a framework to develop it whether it’s a presentation, an article, or a sales pitch.
         </p>

         <p>
           Be honest with your audience, back up your facts, deliver on your promises, and you’ll build long-term value and trust.
         </p>

         <p>
           Show readers “what could be” as opposed to “what is” currently. Take Nancy Duarte’s example of <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/06/how-to-identify-and-tell-your-most-powerful-stories" target="_blank">writing powerful stories</a> using the same techniques as great storytellers.
         </p>

         <p>
           People are willing to engage with brands (and trust them) by consuming their content. But the content needs to tell a story.
         </p>

         <p>
           And why storytelling plays such an important role in this marketing ploy is because, essentially, humans have been telling stories for millennia — so for evolutionary reasons, storytelling has remained ingrained in our DNA.
         </p>

         <p>
           Historically, humans have always created myths and lived in dual realities to gain flexibility and cooperate in a sustainable way.
         </p>

         <p>
           It makes perfect sense that evolution has taught humankind to live through stories — and that today, this process continues to be translated into our everyday lives, our work, and, ultimately, into the way we give brands a unique voice.
         </p>

         <p>
           Our brains are wired to look for stories, which is why content remains the best medium to connect with your audience.
         </p>

         <p>
           <strong>When you create something that solves problems and inspires, content that caters to a clear target audience, you create a space where readers always want to return to.</strong>
         </p>

         <p>
           Exceptional content and loyal readership take time to build. That’s why, delivering stories that connect and endure, laying the right foundations and being steadfast to your principles is crucial.
         </p>

         <p>
           As content increasingly becomes the norm, tactical storytelling is deemed as a science in itself. But in the end, what makes good stories work lies in the creative quality that makes humans human.
         </p>

       <h3 id="culture-of-feedback">2. A Culture of Feedback</h3>

         <p>
           <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonfried?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" target="_blank">Jason Fried</a>, Basecamp CEO, wrote that “making anything better is iteration.” To paraphrase him, iteration prompts teams “to perform or utter repeatedly.”
         </p>

         <p>
           Everyone knows that iterating is crucial for success. We understand this because once a product is launched, we need to quickly get the most valuable feedback on what is right and wrong.
         </p>

           Any type of work needs to be rolled out quickly to get feedback and then moved back again to make sure it satisfies the highest level of quality.
         </p>

         <p>
           In Fried’s book “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Doesnt-Have-Be-Crazy-Work/dp/0062874780" target="_blank">It Doesn’t Have to Be Crazy at Work</a>“, the entrepreneur states that you should treat your company as a product.
         </p>

         <div class="collab">
           To improve a product, you listen, learn, (re)consider, concept, and iterate. The same approach should be used to improve your company itself. How you work, how you manage, how you develop and communicate policies and procedures should all improve through iteration as well.
         </div>

         <p>
           Companies should always invite feedback and create an environment of iterative learning. By nature, these processes are about learning and progressing to the next level. For every new iteration, feedback needs to be asked so that the next iteration moves in the right direction.
         </p>

         <p>
           One concept Intercom enforces is the “Ship to Learn” principle which means that the sooner you ship, the sooner you get feedback on your assumptions and your solution, so you can learn quickly if you’re making an impact.
         </p>

         <p>
           Slack is also known for establishing collaboration through feedback sessions and they strongly emphasize a top-down culture where leaders encourage employees who learn how to be collaborative at work through emails or short interactions.
         </p>

         <p>
           “Often, high-performing teams respond less to perks than to a workplace that offers them the best tools to work with, meaningful connections, a culture of collaboration, and leaders who are <a href="https://slackhq.com/trust-tools-and-teamwork-what-workers-want" target="_blank">transparent and value teamwork</a>.” Slack
         </p>

         <p>
           <strong>Other methods to build a culture of feedback</strong>
         </p>

         <p>
           <ul>
             <p>
               <li><strong>Make feedback a habit: </strong>After each project, ask peers what worked, what didn’t, and how to do better next time. Clearly communicate the intention behind the feedback you’re giving. Do it personally.</li>
             </p>

             <p>
              <li><strong>Create spaces for sharing quick feedback: </strong>channels are a hub for shared ideas and work nicely when you need to request for anything from simple requests to larger projects.</li>
             </p>

             <p>
               <li><strong>Use a <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/feedback-loop" target="_blank">feedback loop</a>: </strong>to help teams get better, behaviour is measured then shared with the person in an emotionally resonant way. Feedback loops use the information to illuminate and prompt individuals to take action.</li>

               <p>
                 A perfect example here is Netflix, which uses the <strong>‘<a href="https://www.custominsight.com/360-degree-feedback/what-is-360-degree-feedback.asp" target="_blank">360-Degree Feedback</a>’</strong> to evaluate employees. The culture encourages constant feedback. <strong>“<a href="https://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664/26-The_Keeper_Test_Managers_UseWhich" target="_blank">The Keeper Test</a>”</strong> is another cultural method the company uses to assess team performance. Managers often ask themselves: Would you fight for this employee?

               <li><strong>Avoid the ‘Shit Sandwich’:</strong> Popularized by the “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Minute-Manager-Kenneth-Blanchard-Ph-D/dp/074350917X" target="_blank">One Minute Manager</a>” book, a shit sandwich is when you layer your feedback in a <em>good-bad-good</em> way. When using this technique, negative feedback is often buried and the interaction becomes very confusing. While this technique seems to be an easy option, it turns out to be counterproductive in shaping an authentic culture.</li>

       <h3 id="the-golden-circle">3. The Golden Circle — Start with Why</h3>

         <p>
           Long before <strong><a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action" target="_blank">Simon Sinek</a></strong> urged leaders to “find their why”, Friedrich Nietzsche stated that anyone “who has a <em>why</em> to live can bear with almost any <em>how.</em>”
         </p>

         <p>
           We have often encountered in the tech world companies’ inability to define their vision by answering these simple questions: why, what, and how.
         </p>

         <p>
           Indeed, there are only a few leaders, products, or companies that create major movements, inspire loyalty and drive change in their organizations.
         </p>

         <p>
           Simon Sinek reinforces this idea by saying that “very few people or companies can clearly articulate WHY they do WHAT they do. By WHY I mean your purpose, cause or belief — WHY does your company exist? WHY do you get out of bed every morning? And WHY should anyone care? People don’t buy WHAT you do, they buy WHY you do it.
         </p>

             “The words “fake it till you make it” motto has become bastardized in the information/social media age.
           </p>

           <p>
             When I first started my career in sales it meant having a belief that you could figure something out…as you were figuring it out. It was about having the confidence to keep pursuing a part of something even though you couldn’t yet see the whole. It was about self-belief and faith.
           </p>

           <p>
             Times have changed. And now, more than ever, it seems to mean if you can put up a facade long enough, you will somehow become that mirage you’re creating. This can actually work long enough to make you think that it’s the right path to go down. Bold claims and boasting seem to perform quite well on social media oddly enough. And this line of thinking will often be propped up by validation from the masses. However, there’s one fatal flaw that brings the house of cards down…the people who aren’t faking it: the experts, the people who have done what you are ‘faking’ and those that are authentic to themselves.
           </p>

           <p>
             By “faking it till you make it” you’re alienated the people in your network that you can learn the most from and pandering to the lowest common denominator. Don’t do it.
           </p>

           <p>
             People (and buyers) are craving authenticity now more than ever. In the information age, knowledge is a commodity. Anyone can learn anything with a quick youtube or google search so claiming to be a guru, ninja, (insert any cringe-worthy buzzword) in your field doesn’t impress people anymore. The only true way stands out in a sea of self-proclaimed experts is to be uniquely you. The you that is riddled with flaws, self-doubt, and imperfections. People don’t trust polish anymore.
           </p>

           <p>
             Isn’t that great news? That the only way to succeed in this new world is to be as YOU as you can possibly be? That’s exciting to me. So next time you’re thinking you have to “fake it till I make it” , I urge you to replace that line of thinking with my favourite Naval Ravikant quote “Escape competition through authenticity.”

       <h3 id="divergent-convergent">4. Divergent x Convergent Thinking</h3>

         <p>
           Before you figure out what to do, you must first figure out how to think like a leader.
         </p>

         <p>
           Nancy Duarte explains in her book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Resonate-Present-Stories-Transform-Audiences/dp/0470632011"target="_blank">Resonate: Present Visual Stories that Transform Audiences</a> that “divergent and convergent thinking styles were identified by J.P. Guilford in 1967 as two different types of thinking that occur in response to a problem. Divergent thinking generates ideas, while convergent thinking sorts and analyzes these ideas towards the best outcome.”
         </p>

         <p>
           Convergent thought is analytical, logical and controlled. It means one “right answer” for a given problem.
         </p>

         <p>
           In contrast, divergent thinking refers to the ability to come up with many solutions or ideas for problems that don’t have one solution.
         </p>

         <p>
           We cannot solve our problems and overcome our challenges by simply doing something different. This requires a different mindset in the people you hire and, eventually, work with or report to.
         </p>

       <h3 id="breaking-information-silos">5. Breaking Information Silos — Tacit → Explicit Knowledge</h3>

         <p>
           In a landscape that is rapidly changing and where our needs are evolving at an accelerating rate, <strong>the companies that are most likely to thrive will be those that provide an opportunity to learn faster.</strong>
         </p>

         <p>
           One of the most difficult challenges companies face today is how to be more flexible and adaptive in a dynamic environment.
         </p>

         <p>
           The top-down cultures in large corporations are slowly giving way to open cultures based on transparency, visibility, and knowledge sharing.
         </p>

         <p>
           The most powerful learning involves leveraging existing knowledge and creating new knowledge.
         </p>

         <p>
           One company which does this is Drift which follows Gary Vaynerchuk’s “<a href="https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/creating-content-that-builds-your-personal-brand/" target="_blank">document, don’t create</a>” strategy of content marketing, which advocates documenting what your company is doing and then sharing it quickly.
         </p>

         <p>
           But how do you embed that kind of mindset into the DNA of a company?
         </p>

         <p>
           <strong>The answer is to distribute control in a way that decisions can be made as quickly and as close to customers as possible.</strong> There is no way for people to respond and adapt quickly if they have to get permission before they can do anything.
         </p>

         <p>
           If you want an adaptive company, you will need to unleash the creative forces in your organization, so people have the freedom to deliver value to customers and respond to their needs more dynamically. One way to do this is by enabling small, autonomous units that can act and react quickly and easily, without fear of disrupting other business activities — pods.
         </p>

         <p>
           In the world of scalable efficiency, the focus was on documenting in great detail the actions that should be taken in addressing specific situations.
         </p>

         <p>
           In a rapidly changing world, much of the new knowledge comes in the form of tacit knowledge — knowledge that resides in our heads but that we have a hard time articulating to ourselves, much less to others.
         </p>

         <p>
           This tacit knowledge evolves as we confront new situations and it is often extremely valuable because it reflects our first-hand experience with the changes that are occurring around us, but it is much harder to access and spread. It typically can’t be written down and shared with others.
         </p>

         <p>
           Scalable learning focuses on creating environments where new tacit knowledge can be created and evolve as workers confront new situations.
         </p>

         <p>
           “The learning challenge for the company comes from the dynamic relationship between the two forms of knowledge. Tacit knowledge is where the action is, and in most cases, it’s the people with the tacit knowledge that deliver the results. But the only way tacit knowledge can be broadly shared is by translating it into explicit knowledge — a very difficult task that very few companies have mastered.”

       <h2 id="authenticity-in-content-">Authenticity in Content</h2>

         <p>
           <span class="capital-l">T</span>o challenge the status quo, companies need to move away from shallow, clickbait pieces to more time in-depth content — to make their voice heard and build more authentic experiences.
         </p>

         <p>
           Connecting companies and readers through quality content written with clear editorial principles that revolve around purpose, by people who are not afraid to deconstruct bold ideas, and who take the time to connect with stakeholders and the community, should be the very foundation of content creation.
         </p>

         <p>
           <strong>Create content that is rich, informative and opinionated, content that is <em>valuable</em> not only with regards to the strength of the ideas, but also how they are framed, the way knowledge is curated and shared, and the experiences readers can relate to.</strong>
         </p>

         <p>
           <strong>How can you write good content?</strong> At GrowthTalk, we have built our very own framework to write authentic long-form pieces.

             “Crafting authentic content is becoming increasingly difficult in the age of information overload. For online media platforms, it is a battle of who can get the most content out in the fastest amount of time and with the most enticing headlines. This is a dangerous race that can sometimes lead to sensationalized stories or the viral spread of disinformation, with the fall out affecting both readers and content creators.
           </p>

           <p>
             The question that content creators have to ask themselves is this: do they want to perpetuate this unhealthy cycle, or do they want to step back and examine how they create a more sustainable model?
           </p>

           <p>
             There are no easy answers to these questions. Media platforms are already experiencing a steep fall in revenue streams, and many have had to rely on creating sponsored content to stay afloat.
           </p>

           <p>
             Personally, the problem can be boiled down to this: how much of a premium do you want to place on authentic content? Insightful and in-depth articles take time, experience, and research to craft. Industry stakeholders — journalists, financial analysts, investors — may see value in paying money for subscriptions to publications.
           </p>

           <p>
             But for the layman and bystander, it will take a lot of awareness and effort to convince them that it is in the public interest that these publications continue to operate; and that being personally invested in them will ultimately benefit both them and society.”

         </p>

         <p>
           Instead of following the traditional content marketing strategy focusing on SEO and backlinks, and publishing as much content as possible, the company developed a unique strategy that made it successful within the startup community and beyond. By focusing on authentic content and dropping the term “content marketing”, Intercom has managed to build a brand that delights.
         </p>

         <p>
           InVision is another outstanding example. The company has built its content strategy as a contributor model which can often be a dangerous choice if you want to maintain quality. But InVision mitigates this risk by setting quality standards and providing contributors with editorial support. They know their community has a lot of insight to offer — and they invest the time to help them unlock it.
         </p>

         <p>
           InVision has created a <a href="https://invisioncommunity.com/news/" target="_blank">platform </a>that gives designers a voice in their community.

           Intercom uses employees and customers to personalize their marketing. And they’ve made a point to be “good enough,” championing a steady output of solid content over a slower, more perfectionist approach.
         </p>

         <p>
           According to John Collins, Director of Content, “There are some companies that are really successful with content marketing driven by aggressive email captures, funnels, and A/B tests. But there’s also a growing cohort of companies who believe that if you <a href="https://www.intercom.com/blog/why-were-dropping-the-term-content-marketing/" target="_blank"></a>focus on publishing authentic, human-first content, you’ll actually need to do minimal marketing to attract people to your product.”
         </p>

         <div class="collab">
           <p>
             “To me, being authentic as a content writer means providing my audience with the full story, not just the parts that serve my interests. Authenticity means I’ve taken the time to investigate the problems and the solutions I’m writing about and have a sincere belief that the information I share is the best available. It means that instead of writing an article that says, “You have a problem and ours is the only solution,” I write an article that says, “You have a problem and here are some of the ways you can choose to solve it, ours is one of them.”
           </p>

           <p>
             Also, being authentic means that when I prepare to write about a new topic, I spend a lot of time doing my initial research. I track down primary sources and check the publication dates of content I want to reference.
           </p>

           <p>
             It is often easier and faster to work backward: starting with a premise then finding the statistics or other facts to support it. But this doesn’t always result in content that serves your audience. The first results of a search aren’t always timely or accurate results and sometimes the top-ranking content misrepresents data or takes it out of context.
           </p>

           <p>
             Other times, the data is just too old to still be relevant — the information has been passed down from one piece of content to the next until it is well past its internet expiration date.
           </p>

           <p>
             My goal as a writer is always to present my audience with actionable information that they can use to solve their problems. Sharing high-quality, relevant content that tells the full story is so much better for your audience and your brand than “faking it.” It is worth the extra effort.”

             <strong>Authenticity is not another shiny tool you sign up for and add to your marketing stack — Erwan Derlyn</strong>
           </p>

         <div class="collab">
           <p>
             “In the last few years, authenticity has become quite a trend in marketing. Every expert blog posts seem to mention authenticity has a must-have in your strategy. The hashtag #nofilter has now be used more than 250m times!
           </p>

           <p>
             But what does it mean to be authentic? Can it actually help you to drive growth? How does it all work? First of all, authenticity is a psychology concept and its definition varies widely in different cultures. Authenticity is deeply connected to self-awareness and self-actualization. For me, business authenticity has a lot to do with consistency and your brand’s reason for being.
           </p>

           <p>
             Seth Godin expresses it perfectly in this blog post “We call a brand or a person authentic when they’re consistent when they act the same way whether or not someone is looking. Someone is authentic when their actions are in alignment with what they promise ”.
           </p>

           <p>
             Being an authentic brand has nothing to do with being extra transparent, or over-sharing content on social media. Being an authentic brand is about standing for something and stick to it — regardless of trends, market evolution, or technology changes. For example, Patagonia’s mission statement and core values haven’t changed since its creation in 1973.
           </p>

           <p><strong>So how can you use authenticity for your brand?</strong></p>

           <p>
             <ul>
               <li>Communicate clearly your vision and mission on your website (eg. The Pursuit of Less by ASKET)</li>
               <li>Use these core values as a red thread across channels (eg. ASKET uses this theme in their newsletters, uses the hashtag #meaningfulessentials on Instagram)</li>
               <li> Become a thought leader within this field (eg. Asket’s founder talks about slowing down fashion on BBC World News)</li>
             </ul>
           </p>

           <p>
             Authenticity is not another shiny tool you sign up for and add to your marketing stack. It’s an active choice and a long-term commitment that will define your brand for years to come.”

         </p>

         <p>
           Harvard Business Review has pinpointed <a href="https://hbr.org/2014/04/creating-a-culture-of-quality" target="_blank">four factors that drive quality as a cultural value</a> which are leadership emphasis, credibility, peer involvement, and employee ownership of quality issues.
         </p>

         <p>
           To that, we’d add that quality means always keeping in mind <a href="https://zest.is" target="_blank">Zest’s</a> Yam Ragev VAT framework — Bring Value, Be Authentic, Stay Transparent.

           While it’s true that quality work and loyal followers take time to build, that’s why, when it comes to delivering something that connects and endures, laying the right foundations and being steadfast to your principles is crucial.
         </p>

         <p>
           To deliver quality, you could experiment with the <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/09/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done" target="_blank">Jobs to Be Done </a>methodology.
         </p>

         <p>
           “Jobs to Be Done” is a concept created by Harvard Business School professor Clayton M. Christensen. The idea is that understanding the jobs customers want to do (or the reasons they buy products) is more useful in helping companies create and sell great products than just having demographic data.

       <h3 id="stick-to-principles">3. Stick to Principles</h3>

         <p>
           The best way to develop new ideas is to start by deconstructing things to the basics. Even if you aren’t trying to develop innovative ideas, understanding the first principles of any field is crucial.
         </p>

         <p>
           Without a firm grasp of a foundation, there is little chance of mastering the details that make the difference.
         </p>

         <p>
           First Principles Thinking is one of the best ways to reverse-engineer complicated problems and unleash creative possibilities. The idea is to break down complicated problems into basic elements and then reassemble them from the ground up.
         </p>

         <p>
           This approach was used by the philosopher Aristotle and is used now by Elon Musk.
         </p>

         <p>
           It’s one of the best ways to learn to think for yourself, unlock your creative potential, and move from linear to non-linear results.
         </p>

         <p>
           <strong>Assumption:</strong>

         <p>
           First Principles:
         </p>

         <p>
           Reasoning by first principles is useful when you are (1) doing something for the first time, (2) dealing with complexity, and (3) trying to understand a situation that you’re having problems with. In all of these areas, your thinking gets better when you stop making assumptions and you stop letting others frame the problem for you.

             “Authenticity in content has a lot to do with mixing and infusing your personal experience with ideas that are already out in the world. To add your own two cents to the ongoing discussion — not borrowed two cents.
           </p>

           <p>
             Look, no thought is original. (We’re all indebted to great thinkers like ASAP Rocky for our content.)
           </p>

           <p>
             But the way you talk about it and present it can be.
           </p>

           <p>
             Even from a purely business point of view, your audience is not going to remember you if your content is the same generic stuff that they can find on 10 other articles. You’re just another article, rather than a value-provider.
           </p>

           <p>
             The way I go about it is to ask myself: What is something that I have learned in my journey, that would be super valuable to my audience? How can I present it in a voice that is unique and does not subtract my own experience from it?
           </p>

           <p>
             When you talk about what you have learned from experience, over time, (and not from 10 articles you googled before creating your content), you’re automatically authentic. It’s that simple.
           </p>

           <p>
             Stop letting your content creators write repetitive copy: choose people who truly understand the industry, can see where your product fits in the market and write copy that your visitors and customers see the value in.
           </p>

           <p>
             I often try to create content that looks at a certain topic from a new angle — topic-selection is a big part of authenticity. I can’t write about the same topic, with the same format, with the same advice in a slightly different language and call it authentic.
           </p>

           <p>
             You’ve got to do SOMETHING new. And that’s where experimentation comes in. You have to think around the generic topics and bring a new perspective to it.
           </p>

           <p>
             I always write a brief which includes <strong>everything</strong> I know about said topic and then piece my article together. I’d recommend that content creation be a collaborative job, where the content creator actively requests insights from the whole team. That way, you can create an article that is filled with different types of experiences and lessons.

             “No matter what career we pursue, what new product or service we bring to market, or what problem we proclaim to solve for customers, there will always be a learning curve. You simply can’t launch something new and authentically declare you have it all figured out. And if you do — you’ll most certainly fail, because all products and services should evolve to meet the changing needs and interests of your customers.
           </p>

           <p>
             So, what does authenticity actually mean in tech and in marketing in particular?
           </p>

           <p>
             For me — it means always being mindful of your customers’ pain. Putting yourself in their shoes. And identifying, with confidence, the problems you solve, and why you solve them better. At <a href="http://www.ada.support/" target="_blank"></a>Ada, where I currently work, our Founders spent many months working in call centres so they could understand, first-hand, the pain in the market. And that informed the technology they built. And continues to inform our marketing strategy, even years later.
           </p>

           <p>
             We begin all of our marketing efforts at Ada with the customer top of mind. And that keeps us very grounded, forces a sense of empathy, and holds us accountable to our customers’ expectations.
           </p>

           <p>
             That said — marketing is always going to involve some spin. Our content showcases an opinionated point of view. And as long as the customer is prioritized in that exercise, I’m 100% ok with it.
           </p>

           <p>
             Companies that are too dependent on faking it, in the absence of authentic consideration of the customer, will be exposed quickly.”

         <p>
           <span class="capital-l">C</span>ulture is a big part of what draws people to join companies. Founders recognize how powerful this is when a company is in its early stages but realise it’s difficult to maintain a consistent culture once the company starts to grow.

           As a venture evolves, identifying with the culture of the organization helps employees work across boundaries and engage in the collaboration and exchange of ideas the company needs to innovate.

           Having a mission helps companies achieve their goals. Missions help teams to make fast decisions. They make it clear that everyone in the company sees why you’re doing what you’re doing.

           You can’t fake culture. There needs to be a perfect alignment between what you think, what you say and what you do.

             Daniel Coyle writes in Culture Code that “Any jackass can kick down a barn, but it takes a good carpenter to build one.” Coyle writes about building organizational culture but opens with the etymology of the word ”cultus”, which means “care” in Latin.
           </p>

           <p>
             Typically, moving fast and caring are usually clashing notions. As the 4th industrial revolution has come upon us, the cult image of fast-growing businesses, with their drummed up successes and hushed flops, combined with the birth of VCs, incubators, and crowdsourcing has led to a competition like never before.
           </p>

           <p>
             A successful entrepreneur requires a certain combination of clear vision, an astute sense of the implicit dynamics and connectedness to the team behind. They will be recognized as authentic when openness, honesty, and steady beliefs are the constant behind any interaction.
           </p>

           <p>
             Harvard Business Review has called authentic leadership as the gold standard of leadership.
           </p>

           <p>
             Many of the successful cultures were forged or crystallized in a time of crisis. Building a culture is not coming from company meetings and memos but from the ever-evolving cycle of trying, failing, reflecting and above all, learning.
           </p>

           <p>
             There are 3 pillars that stand out as common throughout the history of the most successful organizations:
           </p>

           <p>
             <ul>
               <li><strong>Showcasing desired exceptional behaviours</strong></li>
                 <p>
                   These can be from challenging the status quo with respect to the work put before, to ritual creation on team or department level that translate the big-picture vision, to relentless innovation while harnessing individual creativity. Speed and margins are important, but they will multiply by elevating everyone’s expectations of what good skill or behaviour means.
                 </p>

                 <li><strong>Make people welcomed, there is strength in diversity</strong></li>
                   <p>
                     The hiring process, your onboarding, communication, growth and promotions, talent management programs, goal setting needs to be a high-intensity feedback loop. Your employees are most time your first source of truth when it comes to the quality of your products or services, whether they are clients themselves whether the first receivers of client info.
                   </p>

                   <p>
                     Creating space for them to express themselves, will determine if your employees are engaged and sharing that critical input. Only then the curiosity of how you can better the organization together will offer value.
                   </p>

                 <li><strong>Aligning language with action</strong></li>
                 <p>
                   While the watercooler moments have their value, in an ever-changing nature of work, more fast-paced, more global, more layered, creating the same known universe is critical and can be done only through consistency.
                 </p>

                 <p>
                   That PR memo needs to be communicated first internally, that re-organization needs to be explained by the same arguments, no matter where they come from, that anti-discrimination or sexual harassment charge needs to be investigated, and that performance or product feedback is valuable only if actioned.
                 </p>

                 <p>
                   It is easier said than done, all the values above to create an authentic culture can easily be stifled by behaviours that break the stride of even the most promising businesses.
                 </p>

                 <p>
                   Some of the biggest blockers in scaling is an attachment to legacy. Kahneman and Tversky bring to light the concept of loss aversion, that can be expressed in certain dimensions by sunk cost fallacy, status quo bias or the endowment effect, which summarized would be “losses loom larger than gains”. And in a start-up life, change seem the only constant. Getting comfortable with that is far from an easy task and requires a certain elasticity of the cultural mindset.
                 </p>

                 <p>
                   At the same time, too much inconsistency, brutal changes or even misplaced internal competition will confuse and create mistrust.
                 </p>

                 <p>
                   All recent studies on why people stay engaged in an organization, despite tremendous obstacles, lead us in the direction of the concept of shared authenticity.
                 </p>

                 <p>
                   People at any level can be confident their peers live by the same values, they make bonds and connections that are sparked by curiosity, mutual respect and meaningful communication. They find mentors, mentees, friends, they build together purpose and rewarding interactions, they bring value they feel proud of on to a wider audience.

           Culture at the heart of your company becomes a part of you. Culture will ideally be expressed rather than created. It should exist naturally within you, your co-founders, your early team. Its expression should also be natural and selective.

           “I want independent thinkers who are going to disagree,” he says “The most important things I want are meaningful work and meaningful relationships. And I believe that the way to get those is through radical truth and radical transparency. In order to be successful, we have to have independent thinkers — so independent that they’ll bet against the consensus. You have to put your honest thoughts on the table.” Then, the best ideas rise to the top.”

           On a team, it’s difficult to get consensus on what the “best” option even means; with an excess of choices, leaders can fall into the paralysis of indecision, wasting precious time and opportunities.

             Building a culture of transparency has to start from the leadership level and cascade down. If execs showcase their own vulnerabilities and embrace a transparent culture, it will carry over throughout an organization. This should impact the way you talk about your performance, progress, and challenges in a truly refreshing way.
           </p>

           <p>
             Acknowledging that no person, product or company is perfect is step one, and this kind of candor will carry through to your customers. With a culture of transparency in place, it becomes OK to acknowledge a gap in your offering or a miss in a prior engagement, which helps you get to the solution stage faster.
           </p>

           <p>
             Think about the term “know-it-all.” Celebrating knowledge, intelligence, and wisdom are characteristics we admire. However, if you call someone a “know-it-all,” you’re insulting them. Why? Because no one actually knows everything, and to pretend you do shows a lack of self-awareness.
           </p>

           <p>
             Imagine being able to lean into your product’s gaps earlier with customers and be able to answer the question, “Should we continue working together?” faster. How many poor-fit customers would that disqualify? Will your ideal customers trust you more? Will your sales reps better focus their efforts toward the right customers?
           </p>

           <p>
             Authenticity and transparency are vital to your long-term success, and this starts from the top. As a leader, encourage your sales team and broader organization to acknowledge faults, embrace being their authentic selves, and share these values with your customers. Show your hand early and often with customers, and remember that great partnerships are built on trust — not bluffs.

       <h3 id="radical-candor">2. Radical Candor</h3>

         <p>
           The concept of leadership has transformed dramatically and if an organization wants to succeed, its leaders must <em>really</em> care about its employees and challenge them at the same time.
         </p>

         <p>
           By definition, “radical candor is the ability to Challenge Directly and show you Care Personally at the same time. … Radical Candor really just means saying what you think while also giving a damn about the person you’re saying it to.”

         </p>

         <p>
           Because leaders find it difficult to give direct feedback in a way that is radically candid and show they care personally about the person whose opinions they are challenging and that we know we may be wrong. Instead, they say it in a way that seems obnoxiously aggressive, dismissing the humanity of the person they are challenging.
         </p>

         <p>
           For leaders or companies that want to adopt this concept, Scott shares a framework that goes as follows: if the vertical axis is caring personally and the horizontal axis is challenging directly, then the feedback should fall in the upper right-hand quadrant.
         </p>

         <p>
           According to Scott, successful companies forge a culture of radical candor — creating bullshit-free zones where people love their work and collaborating with team members.
         </p>

         <p>
           As humans, we often care <em>without</em> challenging, which leads to ‘ruinous empathy’ and bad ideas, or challenge <em>without</em> empathy, which results in ‘obnoxious aggression’ instead.
         </p>

         <p>
           The worst possible scenario is when we do not challenge people directly and we also don’t care about them — that causes ‘manipulative insincerity’ and lands us straight into trouble.
         </p>

         <p>
           Radical Candor happens when people develop the ability to challenge ideas, concepts, proposals directly and productively while demonstrating personal care for the person they are giving/receiving feedback from. When you create an internal culture where people truly care for one another, this attitude naturally gets passed onto your customers, too.

           Putting yourself in your peers’ shoes makes a huge difference in business.
         </p>

         <p>
           Think about the questions employees, customers, stakeholders, and investors would ask when considering your business, products, brand, and marketing strategies. By looking at things through a different lens, you can better understand how to reach out and connect with the people who matter to your business.

         <p>
           Questions have great power for businesses today. Building a <a href="https://www.emotivebrand.com/white-paper/the-meaningful-workplace/" target="_blank">meaningful workplace culture</a> that encourages asking questions can be of great value to your business. Employees and leaders who ask the right questions are more engaged, think more creatively, and in the end, have the ability to power innovation.

             Tuning in for Success

             Growth & Monetary Gain
           </p>

           <p>
             We cannot mourn a loss if it is not directly visible what we have lost. Financial gain is easily tracked and seems like a tangible result. Other factors that contribute to success may be more complex to pin down. Do we have access to the best talent out there? Do people want to stay once they’re in? Why do people leave? Do people contribute the best they can? Is there a conflict that keeps people from working together effectively? The questions require a leader’s ability to see teams and individuals as more than executing forces to attain monetary gains and growth results.
           </p>

           <p>
             These questions require that a leader tunes in to their employee's experiences. Ironically, when the loss of talent and ideas would be counted in the profit and loss calculation, it quickly would become apparent that addressing questions around inclusion, belonging and team culture becomes an economic imperative. Unfortunately, a myopic monetary gains view on the course of action often disables leaders to see their loss.
           </p>

           <p>
             Leadership
           </p>

           <p>
             When leaders foster a culture of empathy, multiple effects can be seen. All brains are put to use because people feel safe to speak up and contribute. Products and services made for people are more likely to be suitable and relevant. Tuning into the experience of a user or customer enables people to make choices and decisions, not solely based on their own experience and needs. Talent stays. When people feel heard, appreciated and that they belong, they are more willing to put in the extra mile and stay at a company.
           </p>

       <h3 id="inclusivity">4. Inclusivity</h3>

         <p>
           According to Buffer, <a href="https://open.buffer.com/diversity-inclusion/#what-is" target="_blank">inclusion</a> is the environment that you create in order to collaborate, support, and respect differences.
         </p>

         <p>
           Do we need to change the culture, and systems that support our working lives? The question is how.
         </p>

         <p>
           Innovation has always been about generating good ideas by challenging the status quo with new viewpoints. That is why inclusivity is fundamental to the sustained success of any innovation ecosystem. Promoting inclusivity in entrepreneurship and technological innovation can deliver greater economic and societal value.
         </p>

         <p>
           Creating diverse and inclusive workplaces isn’t just a “nice” thing to do. There is a well-documented case for how creating an inclusive culture positively impacts the bottom line.
         </p>

         <p>
           Research has shown that <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-diversity-makes-us-smarter/" target="_blank">socially diverse groups (those with a diversity of race, ethnicity, gender, and sexual orientation) are more innovative</a> than homogeneous groups.
         </p>

         <p>
           One area to consider is inclusive design, which helps companies create products that serve as many people as possible. While accessibility is a core objective, inclusion enables people with diverse characteristics to use your product in a variety of different environments.
         </p>

           In content, editorial styles are continuously evolving to reflect shifts in needs, sensibilities, technologies, and markets, so it’s important to write in such a way that reflects the audience you are writing for.
         </p>

         <p>
           MailChimp is one example that has <a href="https://styleguide.mailchimp.com/writing-about-people/" target="_blank">clear guidelines for writing about people with compassion</a>.
         </p>

         <p>
           <a href="https://sproutsocial.com/seeds/writing/goals-and-principles#write-for-inclusion" target="_blank">Sprout also emphasizes the need to be careful about the bias</a> that can creep in the smallest word choices. The company takes extra care to be cognizant of the impact their words have to make people feel seen, valued, respected and welcome.
         </p>

         <p>
           It’s clear — we need to promote critical thinking about language and ways we can use conscious words, portrayals, framing, and representation to empower instead of limit.

         <p>
           So the question is — is relentlessly pursuing growth good for business?
         </p>

         <p>
           Despite the obsession with moving faster, a study made by Slack shows that researchers from UC Berkeley and Stanford who explored <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/startupcompass-public/StartupGenomeReport2_Why_Startups_Fail_v2.pdf" target="_blank">growth at more than 3,000 startups</a> found that growth was that premature scaling was the most common cause of failure.
         </p>

         <p>
           As Julie Zhuo states, “I tell my team that when the discussion becomes “should we ship this mediocre thing, or should we spend the additional time that we don’t have to make it better?” the battle has already been lost. The thing we failed to do weeks or months ago was cutting aggressively enough. Either this thing matters, in which case make it great — don’t make it mediocre. Or it doesn’t, in which case, don’t work on it in the first place.”

           In his famous article, <a href="http://paulgraham.com/ds.html" target="_blank">Paul Graham advises companies to do things that don’t scale</a>. His argument is that doing things on a smaller scale at the beginning lays the foundation for success.
         </p>

         <p>
           Fast growth has become the metric of success for many companies. But while growth is a critical metric, it has to be understood within a wider context.
         </p>

         <p>
           Graham explains that growth comes in three phases — starting with a period of slow or no growth. And rather than something to avoid, it enables long-term success and sustainable business.
         </p>

         <p>
           But before moving too fast, companies need to learn to focus on quality, strengthen their products, understand customers, identify the market, build a stellar team, and establish trust.

             Test Before you Scale — Seriously & Systematically.
           </p>

           <p>
             So you’ve read that the newest trick on the marketing block is to add a chatbot to your website, that will capture and process information, and timely deliver a notification to your salespeople. Or maybe, you heard that Artificial Intelligence is in, and you definitely need it. Whatever the scenario, the first mistake people make is to assume that you need to go from 0 to 100 in one leap.
           </p>

           <p>
             Let’s take the chatbot as an example since we’ve been testing that concept lately.
           </p>

           <p>
             Empirically, I can deduce that there is a high probability that there’s value in adding either a chatbot or a live chat on my website. I know that because companies like Drift and Intercom have numerous case studies out there. Even Hubspot has a built-in chat flow functionality nowadays.
           </p>

           <p>
             So the next step is to set up an elaborate chat-flow or enable live chat worldwide that is connected to all of your sales reps?
           </p>

           <p>
             It doesn’t make sense to me. There are still things I do not know:
           </p>

           <p>
             It doesn’t make sense to me. There are still things I do not know:
           </p>

           <p>
             - Are visitors even remotely interested in chatting to me?
           </p>

           <p>
             - Do they want to chat with a real person?
           </p>

           <p>
             - Or simply get directed to relevant content?
           </p>

           <p>
             - Are they willing to leave their contact details over chat?
           </p>

           <p>
             - Are these people random visitors, relevant prospects, or clients?
           </p>

           <p>
             The logical next step is to add some proxy metrics to each of my questions, and one step at a time to start loading data into them. The goal is, simply speaking to figure out:
           </p>

           <p>
             “Based on initial data, is it worth pursuing this project” — Yes/No
           </p>

           <p>
             If yes, “Based on the data, what direction should I take my chat”
           </p>

           <p>
             Let’s look at the very first question. Will people open the chat, to begin with?
           </p>

           <p>
             For me, I’d simply look at “unique visitor session to started chat” -rate. If the number is high, good stuff — I can proceed to test out what kind of content the bot should present.
           </p>

           <p>
             If it’s not, I can try a few things to up the rate:
           </p>

           <p>
             - Change welcome message → from “Hello let us know if you have any questions” to “Hello, let me help you find what you’re looking for”
           </p>

           <p>
             - Change placement of chat (pages) → from a few specific pages to all pages on the website
           </p>

           <p>
             - Visual aspects → from a small notification that looks like the rest of your site to a bright red box that yells at you
           </p>

           <p>
             Once I’m confident I have a good-enough answer (note: at this stage, I’m not looking for statistical significance, just directional), I can move on to the next question. By the end of this process, I will have built up a few assumption based funnels, and collected data for each step.
           </p>

           <p>
             I can also stop or change direction if I notice that some parts are not working as expected. For the following questions, I would follow the same steps:
           </p>

           <p>
             - Create an assumption
           </p>

           <p>
             - Choose a proxy metric that you believe will give you an answer
           </p>

           <p>
             - Pump data in
           </p>

           <p>
             - Modify based on performance
           </p>

           <p>
             - Be ready to make “kill or continue” decisions.
           </p>

           <p>
             And most importantly, if I approach a scalable project like this in a systematic way, I can avoid the worst marketing trap ever: “We tried X, it simply didn’t work for our company.”
           </p>

          So, do this. Start with why.
         </p>

         <p>
           Put stories at the forefront of everything you do. Understand how your company, product, content can help your audience.
