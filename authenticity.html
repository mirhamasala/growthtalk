          <span class="capital-l">I</span>n this playbook, we’ve gathered insights, frameworks, experiences, and principles to understand why we need to re-think the way companies craft authentic experiences that are meant to inspire change.
        </p>
        <p>
          We asked seasoned experts to share valuable lessons and strategies about how to focus on human-first content, build cultures with stronger values, settle clashing perspectives about what it means to run a successful company, and implement sustainable growth strategies.
        </p>
        <p>
          We need to reframe our strategies to be more genuine and sustainable. And this starts with being more authentic in all areas that make a company thrive.
        </p>

        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          <span class="capital-l">W</span>e see a deluge of newly launched start-ups and a new wave of entrepreneurs who swear by Zuckerberg’s once-notorious motto: “<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-10/zuckerberg-hearings-presage-end-of-move-fast-break-things-era" target="_blank">move fast and break things.</a>”
        </p>
        <p>
          This mindset was devised to spark innovation, but today it encompasses how many entrepreneurs see disruption: speed is key. But is this still the case?
        </p>
        <p>
          According to <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/01/the-era-of-move-fast-and-break-things-is-over" target="_blank">HBR</a>, this mentality forces companies to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/theranos-and-silicon-valleys-fake-it-till-you-make-it-culture/" target="_blank">rush to force products into consumers’ hands as fast as possible,</a> without regard for proper functionality, understanding the market’s needs, or sustainable growth strategies.
        </p>
        <p>
          But mantras like ‘fail fast, fail often’ and ‘move fast and break things’ are starting to fail to live up to expectations when companies begin to consider the long-term impact and ethical responsibility they need to build trust.
        </p>
        <p>
          As <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/treat-me-like-a-person-not-a-persona" target="_blank">HubSpot CTO Dharmesh Shah states in the Customer Code</a> “customers don’t mind paying, but they do mind being played.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking at content marketing, the tech world has become saturated with SaaS companies producing content. Most of them mindlessly follow the industry “best-practices” and produce uncompelling content that lacks an authentic story in the pursuit of clicks.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are aware that the “Fake It Till You Make It” mindset originates from the philosophy of positive thinking and implies a theory of “you can do anything” by convincing yourself that you can really do it.
        </p>
        <p>
          And we don’t want to make <i>authenticity</i> just another buzzword that aims to jolt the start-up world.
        </p>
        <p>
          But as <a href="https://blog.samaltman.com/" target="_blank">Sam Altman</a> puts it “We tell startups all the time that they have to grow quickly. That’s true, and very good advice, but I think the current fashion of Silicon Valley startups has taken this to an unhealthy extreme — startups have a weekly growth goal before they really have any strong idea about what they want to build.”
        </p>

        <h2 id="why-authenticity-matters">Why authenticity matters</h2>

        <p>
          <span class="capital-l">A</span>uthenticity is a highly-sought value but very few companies know how to forge a genuine culture and craft strategies that put it at the core.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>After all, there is no cookie-cutter template for instilling authenticity in a company but there are ways to develop it.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          To start, think about how we are permanently surrounded by technology; the more we are dominated by the tech world, the more we want to fight the noise and enjoy authentic experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Companies know this so they will need to build frameworks that connect with people and offer them the authentic experiences they are looking for.
        </p>
        <p>Authenticity matters because:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>It fosters credibility</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>It gives companies a unique personality</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>It allows companies to establish trust</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>It establishes high quality</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>It fosters loyalty</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="collab">
          <p>
            In this day and age, you have no choice but to be authentic. People can detect bullshit from miles away, especially online. To be authentic, you first need to understand who you are and what you stand for and against.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you don’t, you’re going to struggle to find your voice and have a tendency to copy what others are doing. It takes time to get to know your true self. It takes time to stop wearing a mask.
          </p>
          <p>
            A good tip to get started is to ask your friends and colleagues what they think you actually stand for and against. You’re going to be surprised by the answers (hint: they are usually the same).
          </p>

        <p>
          And in 2019, we have identified a few concepts that further corroborate the need for authenticity:
        </p>

        <h2 id="authenticity-in-a-company">How to instill authenticity in a company</h2>

        <p>
          <span class="capital-l">T</span>he identity of a company is based on <strong>values, principles, story, vision, and a clear mission,</strong> but it’s also closely linked with the personality and voice that define who you are and what sets you apart from the crowd.
        </p>
        <p>
          InVision says that “the brand’s identity is how it looks and feels”, which means that the elements of a brand are visual. More than the visual direction, the story is always key.
        </p>
        <p>So you could start with, “What is the story you’re telling?”
        </p>
        <p>
          A strong story helps companies convey the type of value they are giving to customers. A story combines every single touchpoint of the user’s experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s essential to start with <a href="https://www.intercom.com/blog/start-with-why-getting-your-story-right/" target="_blank">your company’s compelling story</a>. Crafting your story to define and express your core ideas will help you create a memorable brand.
        </p>
        <p>
          An example is <a href="https://www.intercom.com/" target="_blank">Intercom</a>, which has a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2016/11/01/inside-intercom-fast-growth-out-of-ireland/#60e3ba946968" target="_blank">compelling story</a> that showcases how a messaging platform mimics the ambiance of the coffee shop where the founders used to work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Intercom’s brand focuses on values like personalization, playfulness, creativity and ease of use. These values immediately translate into their visual language: playful colours, quirky illustrations, magazine-like blog.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond the visuals, Intercom has weaved its strong story by constantly asking “why.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “No matter how good your product is, if you can’t tell a cohesive, compelling story about it, you’re going to have a very hard time getting people’s attention when you actually do take it to market.” Intercom
        </p>
        <p>
          In a competitive market, a company can’t differentiate itself only by offering a product. The idea is to craft a cohesive story across all the areas of the company starting with the visual brand, the product or service, the mission and vision of the founders, the team, the content, and the marketing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Or as Intercom says it “it’s about understanding why a customer would care about that mission, and translating that understanding into a story that will compel someone to start a trial and ultimately make a purchase.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Every company has a different way of instilling trust in their brand. Buffer puts emphasis on transparency to build trust faster, so they have created a <a href="https://buffer.com/about#transparency" target="_blank">transparency dashboard</a>. Drift’s hypothesis establishes authenticity as a way to trust so they <a href="https://medium.com/the-mission/the-real-housewives-of-tech-marketing-16cc34ebea69" target="_blank">built their own reality TV show</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Slack’s manifesto is less deliberate, more organic and shows how <i>humanity</i> builds trust faster than all the other methods. It’s a core part of their voice (<a href="https://slackhq.com/one-voice-many-hands" target="_blank">clear, concise, and human</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
          The human experience is reflected throughout the organization as Slack shares <i>emotion</i> with their readers (<a href="https://twitter.com/slacklovetweets" target="_blank">Wall of Love</a>), and conveys it through <i>quality work</i> by investing heavily into its content creation.

          The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.

          Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
